Attendees from outside UCL can attend, you will need to sign up.

We only have space for ~40 people this year, so we will work on the basis of first come first served.
We assume you already know the basics of Nextflow and a bit of nf-core to attend. The hackathon will not be a training event per se. But...
We will be hosting a little nf-core pre-hackathon training on the 5th of March for thse who have little/no experience with nf-core but want to contribute. Please, sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbZdr_sz2LmFwITzCpacF8C2y-MhAqH6hjk2hiJIpgurfgeA/viewform?usp=header) for the pre-event training.

## Projects

We will work on open issues around nf-core pipelines, including:
[nf-core/gwas](https://github.com/nf-core/gwas)

Any other people wanting to lead a particular pipeline at this event should register their project on the hackathon page, and let us know.
