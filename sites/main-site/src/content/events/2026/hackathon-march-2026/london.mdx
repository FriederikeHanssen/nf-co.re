Attendees from outside UCL can attend, you will need to sign up.
We only have space for ~40 people this year, so we will work on the basis of first come first served.
We assume you already know the basics of Nextflow and a bit of nf-core to attend. The hackathon will not be a training event per se. But...
We will be hosting a little nf-core pre hackathon training on the 5th of March. Details to come soon, for those who want to learn how to contribute.

## Projects

We will work on open issues around nf-core pipelines, including:
[nf-core/gwas](https://github.com/nf-core/gwas)

Any other people wanting to lead a particular pipeline at this event should register their project on the hackathon page, and let us know.
