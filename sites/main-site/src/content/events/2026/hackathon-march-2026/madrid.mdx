# Participation

Attendees from outside ISCIII and outside Madrid **can** attend.

Please make sure to select this local site during registration.

Kindly contact the local organizers, Sarai, Daniel or Sara (listed above), prior to the event, as we have limited space. We hace space for 25 attendees.

# Site Specific guidelines

We will have two meeting rooms booked for the entire hackathon (to be confirmed):

- Meeting room 1: 53-00-239 (space for 12 people)
- Meeting room 2: 53-00-240 (space for 13 people)

This means we can host up to 25 participants.

# Projects

We will work on open issues around nf-core pipelines, including:

- nf-core/viralrecon: this project is meant to be hybrid (onl-ine and local) as people from outside Spain will be joining too.
- nf-core/bacass: you can join in person and on-line

# Schedule

Schedule TBD

### Lunch

There will be access to microwaves for heating lunch boxes, and some people will likely buy food at the cafeteria as well.
