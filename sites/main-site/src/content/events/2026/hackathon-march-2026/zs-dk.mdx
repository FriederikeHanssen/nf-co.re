Anyone can attend! You just need to sign up!.
This year we will be co-hosting the event with Samuel Ruiz-Pérez from the [Center for Epigenetic Cell Memory at the Danish Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.dk/danish-cancer-institute/research-groups/).

We only have space for ~25 people this year, so we will work on the basis of first come first served.
We assume you already know the basics of Nextflow and a bit of nf-core to attend. The hackathon will not be a training event per se. But...
We will be hosting a little nf-core pre hackathon training session on how to contribute, and how to navigate over the hackathon.

Main contacts:
Felipe Almeida ([felipe.almeida@zs.com](mailto:felipe.almeida@zs.com))
Samuel Ruiz-Pérez ([samper@cancer.dk](mailto:samper@cancer.dk))

## Projects

Samuel is planning to lead a local project this year in our site. More information to come.

We will also work on open issues around nf-core pipelines, including:
[nf-core/gwas](https://github.com/nf-core/gwas)

Any other people wanting to lead a particular pipeline at this event should register their project on the hackathon page, and let us know.
