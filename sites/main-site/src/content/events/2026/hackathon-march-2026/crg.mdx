## Projects

We will work on open issues around nf-core pipelines, including:

- nf-core/proteinfold: this is a project worked on in collaboration with other local sites. We will work exclusively in person from the CRG and sync every day with the work done by collaborators from Australia.

This will an _in-person_ site.
We can't guarantee a space where on-line meetings can be taken.

If you want to come with your colleagues to work on a project on-site, please open a PR to add the project to these descriptions!
Your suggestions are more than welcomed and further details will be published soon.
