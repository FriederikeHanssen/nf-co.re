Local hub for the "Seqinspector improvements" project!

## Site Specific guidelines

We have two smaller rooms booked for the entire hackathon:
E10:2314 (space for 8 people)
E10:2308 (space for 6 people)

This means we can host up to 14 participants.

Access to the rooms requires Navet access.
If you don't have this, someone from the local team will meet you at the C11 entrance (SciLifeLab sign) in the morning.

### Lunch

There will be access to microwaves for heating lunch boxes, and some people will likely buy food at the cafeteria as well.

## Schedule

Schedule TBD

## Projects

Seqinspector improvements.
