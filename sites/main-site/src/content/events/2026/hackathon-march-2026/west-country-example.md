## ⚠️ THIS IS AN EXAMPLE LOCATION FILE

This location is **not real** and serves as a template for creating actual hackathon site pages.

Attendees from outside Arthur's house **cannot** attend (it's quite small and about to be demolished).

Main contact: Arthur Dent ([adent@example.com](mailto:adent@example.com))

## Venue Details

A cozy cottage in the English countryside. Please note: construction of the hyperspace bypass has been temporarily postponed for this event.

**What to bring:**

- Your towel (essential)
- A working knowledge of Nextflow (more useful than knowing where your towel is)
- Tea (the venue only has nutri-matic dispensers)

**Parking:** Limited. The bulldozers have been asked to leave for the week.

## How to Use This Template

To create a real location file, copy this and update with actual venue information, coordinates, and contact details. Remove all example warnings and Hitchhiker's Guide references.
