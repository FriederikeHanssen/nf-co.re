## Projects

We will work on open issues around nf-core, including:

- nf-core/modules: This primary repository is essential for the nf-core community and requires a thorough cleanup. Our aim is to migrate it to the latest Nextflow strict syntax with no errors nor warnings !
- nf-core/phaseimpute: This pipeline project offers tasks suitable for contributors at all skill levels.

If you and your colleagues are interested in collaborating on a project at the hackathon, feel free to submit a pull request (PR) to include your project! We welcome your suggestions, and more details will be shared soon.
