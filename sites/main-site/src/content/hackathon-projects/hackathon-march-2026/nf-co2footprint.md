## Summary

Contribute to the nf-co2footprint plugin that estimates energy consumption and CO₂ equivalent emissions of workflow runs. This hackathon focuses on improving the HTML report and visualizations, as well as strengthening the integration of the plugin into nf-core pipelines and configurations.

## Goal

Make sustainability reporting in nf-core workflows intuitive, reliable, and easy to adopt, and encourage more sustainable computational research practices within the community.

## Tasks

- **Add informative (& interactive) visualizations to the HTML output report**  
  Issue [#341](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-co2footprint/issues/341) describes the ideas.  
  **Level:** Beginner-friendly. Basic knowledge of HTML, JavaScript (and Plotly) is helpful.

- **Add nf-co2footprint to your config files**  
  This can be as easy as adding the plugin ID to your institution’s config, but accuracy may improve by supplying additional parameters.  
  Let’s do it together and discuss how this process could be streamlined for other plugin users.  
  **Level:** Open to everyone.

- **nf-core 🤝 nf-co2footprint plugin**  
  As our long-term goal is to make the plugin an integral part of the **nf-core** framework, we are always open to suggestions, feedback, and ideas that help us move in that direction.
