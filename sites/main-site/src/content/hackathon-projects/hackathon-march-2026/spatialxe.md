Contribute to [nf-core/spatialxe](https://nf-co.re/spatialxe/dev/) pipeline, mostly working on several listed [issues](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialxe/issues).

## Goal

We aim to extend the functionality of the pipeline and contribute to subworkflows in nf-core.

## Tasks

1. Adding tools to nf-core/modules

- Issue [#38](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialxe/issues/38)
- Issue [#42](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialxe/issues/42)
- Issue [#51](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialxe/issues/51)
- Issue [#66](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialxe/issues/66)

Level: For people with some experience in Nextflow or nf-core pipelines and image based spatial transcriptomics technologies. Also beginners are welcomed.

2. Methodology development

- QC (will be discussed during the hackathon if people are interested)
- Allow to choose different or multiple channels
