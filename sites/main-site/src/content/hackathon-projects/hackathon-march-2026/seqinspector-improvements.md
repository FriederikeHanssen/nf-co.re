## Goal

Working towards a 1.1.0 release of the pipeline. Adding more modules, fixing bugs, implementing strict Nextflow syntax and improving documentation.

:::note
At the time of writing, v1 has not yet been released, but Maxime has promised it will happen before the hackathon and we put our trust in him.

## Description

Read about the seqinspector pipeline here: https://nf-co.re/seqinspector/dev/

The pipeline is still young and we encourage everyone interested in using it to join our efforts to make it harder, better, faster and stronger!

The project will take place at the local hub in Uppsala.
