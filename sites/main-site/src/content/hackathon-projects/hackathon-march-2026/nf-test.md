This project aims to update and fix several bugs and issues in the [nf-test](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test) codebase, which is used for testing nf-core pipelines.

## Goal

Work on resolving nf-test issues and add new features to the codebase.

## Tasks

These task are some of the higher priority ones, but feel free to check the [issues on github](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/issues) and pick any that you find interesting.

### [Add support for topic channels](https://github.com/askimed/nf-test/issues/258)

nf-test does not yet support the new topic channels introduced in Nextflow 25.04.0. This will make testing our modules using the new topic channels easier.
