This project aims to update [nf-core/viralrecon](https://nf-co.re/viralrecon/dev) pipeline by addressing key issues from the [nf-core/viralrecon Hackathon March 2026 Milestone](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/milestone/7)

## Goal

1. Improve Nanopore data analysis for better long-read handling
   1. Add de novo assembly
   2. Add mapping, variant calling, and consensus genome generation independent of the ARTIC pipeline
2. Add IRMA (CDC) to viralrecon for RSV and influenza analysis
3. Improve the viralrecon de novo assembly subworkflow
4. Fix existing bugs

[Milestone for the hackathon](https://github.com/nf-core/viralrecon/milestone/7)
