This project has the ambitious objective of making the first release of [nf-core/seqsubmit](https://nf-co.re/seqsubmit/dev) pipeline.

The list of [issues](https://github.com/nf-core/seqsubmit/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/nf-core/seqsubmit/pulls) to tidy up.

## Goal

Complete the work done in the [Hackathon Barcelona October 2025](https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/projects/136/views/2?filterQuery=seqsubmit), and make the first release of the pipeline!

The first version will support:

- [raw-reads](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads.html)
  - This also involves getting more documentation for users
- [metagenomic assemblies](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/metagenome.html)
  - [binned metagenomic assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binning_%28metagenomics%29)
- [metagenome-assembled genomes](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/metagenome/mag.html)

## Tasks

See below a few potential tasks to work in the hackathon.
Depending on the participation and level of the attendees, more issues could be made available for the hackathon.

### Improve documentation

Uploading data to the [INSDC](https://www.insdc.org/) archives involves understanding many acronyms and terms. Good documentation is critical for users.

### Add support for raw-reads data submission

The submission of raw-reads data needs to be implemented.

Issue [#28](https://github.com/nf-core/seqsubmit/issues/28)

### Issues and pull requests reviews

There are other [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/nf-core/seqsubmit/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/nf-core/seqsubmit/pulls) to review, feel free to check them out or add yours if you encounter any.
