This project aims to update [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) with newer Nextflow features, in particular, we are going to be focusing on **topic channels.**

You can read more about topic channels in the [latest Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/channel.html#topic)

You can monitor current adoption stats across nf-core modules [here](https://nf-core-stats.netlify.app/code/container_conversion/#version-topics-adoption-over-time)

## Goal

Adopt topic channels in all nf-core modules.

## Tasks

### Implement topic channels in all nf-core modules

- Replace version collection with Nextflow topic channels and follow the [official nf-core migration instructions](https://nf-co.re/docs/tutorials/migrate_to_topics/update_modules)

## Prior training
