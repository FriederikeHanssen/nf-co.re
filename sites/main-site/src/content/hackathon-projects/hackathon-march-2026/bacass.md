This project aims to update [nf-core/bacass](https://nf-co.re/bacass/dev) pipeline by addressing a set of key open issues to improve assembly flexibility, expand tooling support, and tighten standards ahead of a future release.

## Goal

1. Modularising and extending core assembly functionality
2. Improving polishing and post-assembly refinement
3. General pipeline improvements and feature gaps
4. Create a metro map that summarises each workflow step

## Prior training

📚 We encourage participants to have completed the following Nextflow training materials:

- [Hello nextflow](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/hello_nextflow/)
- [Nextflow run](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/nextflow_run/)
- [Hello nf-core](https://training.nextflow.io/latest/hello_nfcore/)

## Where
