# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for an episode of our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 20: Nextflow Tower

This week, Evan Floden ([@evanfloden](http://github.com/evanfloden/)) will provide some updates on Nextflow Tower (<https://tower.nf>), including the new Community Showcase with nf-core pipelines, a first look at the datasets feature, the upcoming CLI, and some automations for triggering the execution of pipelines.
