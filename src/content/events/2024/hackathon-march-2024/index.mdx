# Topics

The hackathon is a great opportunity to work on any nf-core related work that you have been putting off or didn't have time for. To help you find like-minded people or possible things to work on, we will have the following topics (formally known as groups):

<HackathonGroup title="Beginners"   leaders={{'mribeirodantas': 'Marcel Ribeiro-Dantas'}}>
    For people who are new to nf-core (but not necessarily new to Nextflow) and need a bit of guidance on where to start.

    > Please note that attendees are expected to know the basics of working with Nextflow.

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="nf-test" color="#238636" >
    The nf-test group will focus on implementing nf-test within nf-core modules, subworkflows, and pipelines.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Adding nf-test to existing pipelines
    - Adding nf-test to modules
    - Adding nf-test to subworkflows
    - Improving nf-test documentation and the nf-core documentation on testing

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Pipelines" color="#bf4b8a" leaders={{
    'FriederikeHanssen': 'Friederike Hanssen',
    'MaxUlysse': 'Maxime Garcia',
    'subwaystation': 'Simon Heumos'
}}>
    The pipelines group will focus on any pipeline-related work.
    This could be a DSL2 conversion of a pipeline, a new or improved feature for a pipeline,
    or an entirely new pipeline
    (please let us register a new pipeline already before the hackathon,
    following [our guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/adding_pipelines#before-you-start)).
    These are typically led by the main pipeline developers if they also attend the hackathon.

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test within pipelines
    - Adding new functionality to existing pipelines
    - Updating pipelines to use the latest nf-core template, via template syncs
    - Teams formed around work on specific pipelines

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Modules & Subworkflows" color="#1f6feb" leaders={{
    'MaxUlysse': 'Maxime Garcia',
    'jonasscheid': 'Jonas Scheid'
}}>
    The modules group welcomes anyone who wants to work on current or new modules + subworkflows
    at [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Implementing nf-test for modules
    - Creating new modules, see issue list
    - Stubs for all modules

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Infrastructure" color="#9e6a03"  leaders={{
    'mashehu': 'Matthias Hörtenhuber',
}}>
    The nf-core website and central tooling are always being improved.
    If you'd like to make a difference to nf-core without writing any Nextflow code,
    this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:

    - Subworkflows nf-core/tools infrastructure
    - Template customisation with feature flags
    - Stripped down/customisable nf-core pipeline template
    - new nf-core website features (if you have some expierence with modern JavaScript or want to learn)
    - improve the devOps for nf-core (GitHub actions, CI/CD, etc.)

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup title="Training materials"  leaders={{
    'FranBonath': 'Franziska Bonath',
}}>
    We are always looking for ways to improve our training materials.
    If you have ideas for new content, or would like to help improve existing content, this is the group for you!

    Suggested projects / teams:
    - Test and improve existing training materials
    - Create new training materials

</HackathonGroup>

<HackathonGroup
    title="Online"
    leaders={{
        yuukiiwa: 'Yuk Kei',
    }}
>
    If you're feeling lost in Gather.town, or just want to hang out with other online attendees, look out for Yuk Kei.
    She'll be able to steer you in the right direction and get you started with one of the project groups.
</HackathonGroup>

# Online: Gather

The hackathon is being held in a virtual venue on the platform Gather. If you have never used Gather before we have [a bytesize video](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/bytesize-37-gathertown) from the March 2022 hackathon that will help you to get started.

We will create a safe list of registered participants that will be able to access the hackathon space. Make sure you register with the e-mail address you will use to access Gather.

# In person: Local sites

In March 2023 we tried something new: distributed local sites.
It was a massive success, with many people volunteering to organise local groups and great feedback all around.
In 2024 we hope to replicate and build on that success! 🚀

Although the hackathon is online, to get the best of both worlds, we encourage everyone to create a local site or attend a nearby site. Be it with your group, institute, city, or region, local sites will be a lot of fun!

> Reminder: Even if you are attending a local site you will still join everyone online in Gather.

## How to create a local site

Anyone can organise a local site. It can be as simple as booking a room and getting some of your friends and colleagues together.

If you would like to create a local site, please join the local [site organisers Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06E1CY29H9) and tell us about your plans. Then, make a pull request to add your site to the table below.

If you can't host a site, but want to check if others in your area are considering it, post on [the main hackathon Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C06GNCNARS5).

When site registration closes, we will open participant registration with your site listed as an attendance option and you will be updated with the list of participants.

# Schedule

The hackathon will run from 10:00 March 18th - 16:00 March 20th (CET). We will do our best to support people in all time zones. 🌎 🌏 🌍

# Code of conduct

Please note that by attending the hackathon you are agreeing to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://nf-co.re/code_of_conduct).
